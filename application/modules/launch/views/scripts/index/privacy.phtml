<h3>A: TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</h3>

<h4>ACCEPTANCE</h4>

<p>
Floplatform.com (“FLO~”) provides this Web Site and the related services (“Services”) to you subject to the following Terms of Service (“Terms”). These Terms may be updated from time to time without notice to the end user. These terms are freely amenable and changeable at any time at the choice or option of FLO~.

</p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h4>

<p>
FLO~ provides users a platform to test and build their ideas and projects, and to connect with other users for the same purposes. At its current stage, however, the FLO~ application is untested ("BETA STAGE") and is therefore soliciting the feedback and usage of individuals ("BETA TESTERS") to further develop this technology. For the purposes of this agreement, “Beta Stage” and “Beta Testers” shall be defined as follows:</p>

<p class="definition">
A test of new or revised hardware or software that is performed by  users at their facilities under a varying array of operating conditions.  These  users (“Beta Testers”) shall not be considered employees nor independent contractors of FLO~.  
</p>

<p>
Unless specifically stated otherwise, any new features or plug-ins that augment the Services are subject to these Terms. You understand that, by agreeing to these Terms, these Services are being provided on an as-is basis. This means that FLO~ assumes no responsibility for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timeliness of Delivery</li>
  <li>Server Uptime</li>
  <li>Accuracy of Information</li>
  <li>Failure to Store Information</li>
  <li>Failure to Transmit Data</li>
</ul>

<p>
Under no circumstances shall FLO~ be responsible for any damages, whether special or consequential, stemming from any of the aforementioned items. The aforementioned disclaimers of liability are not the sole disclaimers sought by FLO~ and should not be construed as such. Further disclaimers or liability shall be found later in this document.
</p>

<p>You must be 18 years old to access these Services.</p>
<p>All Terms in this agreement are subject to our privacy policy, below.</p>

<h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

</p>

<p>
Certain areas of the web site may require registration or may otherwise ask you to provide personal information to participate in certain features or access certain content.  The decision to provide this information is purely optional; however, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content or participate in certain features of the web site. When you provide information to the web site, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information on all registration pages.
Any information that can be used to identify a person is “Personal Information.” This does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous. All information is securely stored on our servers in the United States.

<p>
We use your Personal Information to provide you the features and functionality of the Service, and may share it with our trusted third parties, to ensure that you have a safe, high-performance experience when using the Service. FLO~ may use certain information about you without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.   This data will also be used to send any number of targeted mailings in order to best serve our user base.
</p>
<p>
FLO~ will not rent or sell your Personal Information to others. FLO~ may share your Personal Information with third parties for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your Personal Information will be bound by terms at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of FLO~ (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
</p>

If such information violates US or International Law, FLO~ may be forced to release user information including IP addresses, names and contact information.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, FLO~ does not guarantee the accuracy of any other content posted on this site (either by a user or by FLO~).

   <p>The survey is designed to mimic the <a href="#" rel="tooltip" data-original-title="Not sure what lean canvas is? Perhaps you should look through our “Process Primer” page">lean-canvas</a> business-model approach, and is at the core of our step-by-step process. Think of this as a living document of your knowledge of your idea, and how much due diligence you’ve done in attempting to turn it into something viable. You don’t need to answer all of them now, just the ones you have answers to. You’ll quickly get to a point where questions you’ve never even thought of come up--that’s when you stop and move on. The survey is meant to be with you  throughout the lifetime of your project on FLO~, and so as you progress through our process, the questions will become more specific and complex. Your survey will always be easily accessible via the dashboard’s specific survey section (and will be viewable for the community to see in the survey tab of your project page) to help keep you thinking about the right priorities. </p>

<h1>Welcome to FLO~! Thanks for taking the time to sign up and hopefully test out our beta application. We’re so excited to have you onboard with us!</h1> 
<p>
We hope to share our vision with you, and grow together into a brand new way of thinking about collaboration and getting ideas off the ground.
</p>
<p>
As the founders of FLO~, Jerry and I started this because we’re both very passionate about starting new projects and creating new things. We wanted to be part of new, interesting projects and developments within our communities, and we wanted to see great ideas get beyond bar talk and idle dreaming. We couldn’t be happier If this helps you to achieve similar goals within your own community and beyond. Hopefully a few months after using our platform, you will be able to tell us that we’ve succeeded in our mission. However, FLO~ can only be as powerful as its community: our effectiveness and value will grow as collaboration and quality contributors grow. This is especially true in our current Beta version. We’ve put in the research (in entrepreneurial theory, in network building, in  social collaboration)  and tried to cobble together an intuitive application complete with the features needed to turn ideas into successful projects. But despite all the research, a lot of it is still our own assumptions. That’s why we need you to tweak and eventually (hopefully) validate those assumptions.This is an opportunity for you to ‘get on at the ground floor’ of a grassroots movement geared towards success, creative discovery, and financial independence - and also to help define the final versions of our application.

<p>
In the coming weeks and months, there will be (many) changes to the functionality and appearance of the FLO~ platform. Your feedback is absolutely crucial to us - especially in these early beginnings - so please don’t be shy and let us know what you think. Do you have any suggestions for the future? Share those with us as well. We’re building this for YOU, so let us know how we can make it even better.
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned for more updates on how we plan on releasing the beta application, as well as how we plan to keep in touch and organize early-user meetups to foster a batch of innovative and successful first projects in the community.
